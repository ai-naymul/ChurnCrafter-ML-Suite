## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

    - Install Python and necessary libraries (CatBoost, Streamlit, FastAPI, Docker).
    - Clone the project repository from GitHub.

## Step 2: Data Acquisition
    - Download the dataset from Kaggle.
    - Ensure you have the correct dataset with 7043 customers and 21 columns.

## Step 3: Data Preprocessing

    - Create a Python file train_model.py.
    - Load the data and handle missing values and categorical variables as shown in the provided code snippet.
    - Split the data into training and testing sets using StratifiedShuffleSplit to maintain distribution of the target variable.

## Step 4: Model Development
    - Train a CatBoostClassifier model using the training data.
    - Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, recall, ROC AUC, and precision.
    - Save the trained model to a directory for later use.

## Step 5: Build the Streamlit Interface

    - Create a file streamlit-app.py.
    - Use Streamlit to build an interactive interface that allows users to input customer data and view the churn probability.
    - Implement SHAP values visualization to explain the model's decisions.
## Step 6: Develop the API with FastAPI

    - Create a file fast-api.py.
    - Set up FastAPI to serve the model predictions over an API.
    - Define endpoints for predicting churn probability based on input data.

## Step 7: Containerize with Docker

    - Create a Dockerfile and a requirements.txt file specifying all necessary Python packages.
    - Build the Docker image and run it to ensure that the application can be executed in an isolated environment.

## Step 8: Testing and Deployment
    - Test the Streamlit interface and the FastAPI endpoints to ensure they work as expected.
    - Deploy the Docker container to a cloud platform if required for production use.

## Step 9: Documentation and Maintenance

    - Document the project setup, usage, and any important information in a README file.
    - Regularly update the libraries and address any issues that arise during the project's lifecycle.

## Step 10: Conclusion

    - Review the project to ensure all components work seamlessly together.
    - Gather feedback to make improvements in future iterations.


This guide provides a comprehensive roadmap to build and deploy a churn prediction model using machine learning, Streamlit for the interface, FastAPI for the API, and Docker for deployment.
